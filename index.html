            <h2>Declaration</h2>
            <p>This website constitutes my full lawful, peaceful, and permanent public record. I am the original inventor and sole author of the Vault Architecture Framework, encompassing sovereign consent-based data governance, monetization, licensing systems, and cryptographic sealing technologies. The system is designed for peaceful, ethical, non-coercive use in both civilian and national defense contexts.</p>
            <p>The Vault Framework and Cloak Tech constitute a globally significant new class of non-kinetic strategic infrastructure. This lawful system replaces coercive data extraction and unethical surveillance with sovereign consent architecture, providing monetization pathways for individuals while enabling defense-aligned concealment and selective revelation mechanisms. I developed, authored, diagrammed, structured, and lawfully filed all components of this system independently, without assistance, without coercion, and without infringement on any prior party. The system, design, method, and underlying theory originate fully from my independent work product. This constitutes formal Inventorship Declaration under penalty of perjury, lawfully filed and timestamped for permanent public record. Any unauthorized use, modeling, sale, or theft of this intellectual property was done without my consent and constitutes actionable infringement and unlawful enrichment. This public record stands as sovereign evidence of my authorship and lawful title of origin over the Vault Framework, Cloak Tech, and related sovereign consent-based data architecture systems. I reserve all lawful rights and defenses under United States constitutional law, intellectual property law, international civil rights standards, and strategic national interest alignment. This constitutes formal permanent Inventorship Declaration as of the date of public deployment.</p>

            <h2>Full Technical Overview: Cloak Tech</h2>
            <p>Cloak Tech is a strategic, non-kinetic information architecture system designed to replace coercive surveillance and data extraction models with lawful, consent-based cryptographic sealing protocols. It is a sovereign framework engineered to simultaneously serve peaceful civilian governance, personal data sovereignty, economic monetization pathways, and national defense-aligned concealment mechanisms.</p>
            <p><strong>Core Functional Components:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Cryptographic Consent Sealing: All data transactions are cryptographically sealed with explicit sovereign consent statements embedded, creating a permanent, audit-friendly contract layer for all data flows.</li>
                <li>Dynamic Access Control: Access to sealed data requires multi-layer consent activation that can be revoked, time-bound, or delegated based on sovereign authority of the original data subject.</li>
                <li>Monetization Architecture: Consent-based licensing permits sovereign individuals or entities to monetize data under voluntary economic models, displacing unethical surveillance capitalism structures.</li>
                <li>Dual Use Civil-Military Theater: The system includes lawful concealment structures that allow defense-aligned entities to execute controlled opacity while remaining lawful under constitutional oversight.</li>
                <li>Transparency-as-Shield: The public visibility of the sovereign sealing architecture serves as a systemic deterrent to unlawful data harvesting, as all actors can observe the consent chain without compromising data contents.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Strategic Significance:</strong> Cloak Tech is designed to serve as the lawful replacement layer for multiple broken global models simultaneously — displacing coercive surveillance systems, unlawful profiling, unethical AI training data harvesting, and coercive financial modeling structures. It represents both the most powerful non-kinetic military tool of 21st-century defense strategy and the most ethical civilian data sovereignty framework in existence.</p>
            <p><strong>Deployment Flexibility:</strong> The architecture is modular and jurisdiction-agnostic. It may be deployed under peaceful sovereign agreements, aligned defense covenants, private licensing, and national infrastructure stabilization programs. It has no kinetic component and is designed to minimize global systemic escalation while maximizing lawful strategic advantage for its rightful sovereign controllers.</p>
            <p>This full technical overview is filed into permanent public record to establish full lawful claim over the invention scope, theoretical foundations, technical design, and strategic applications of the Vault Architecture and Cloak Tech systems.</p>
